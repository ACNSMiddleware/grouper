Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_3_0rc01
----------------------------------------------------
Changes in this version:
(All changes from CVS tags SIGNET_1_2_2a through SIGNET_1_2_2i, inclusive)

API Changes
-----------
1.  Added XML import/export capability
2.  Increased visibility of several class' methods.
3.  Some minor cleanup/fixup of javadoc comments.
4.  Added getActingAs() method to SignetSubject.java.
5.  Fixed problem with TreeNodeImpl.toString() regarding display of Scope Tree
    in UI.
6.  Changed AssignmentImpl.scope from TreeNode to TreeNodeImpl. This changes
    the API for AssignmentImpl.java. Spcifically - the constructor, setScope,
    and getScope.
7.  Generalized SignetApiUtil.setEntitysSignetValue to accept 
    Collection<EntityImpl> instead of Set
8.  Made the following classes (or methods in them) public: ChoiceImpl, 
    ChoiceSetImpl, GrantableImpl, 
9.  Removed unused methods
    edu.internet2.middleware.signet.Entity.getCreateDatetime()
    edu.internet2.middleware.signet.EntityImpl.setCreateDatetime()
10. Removed references to Permissions from LimitImpl (unused, and also 
    doubly-linked)
11. Removed references to Functions from Permission (unused, and also
    doubly-linked)

======================================== 
Signet  07/11/07

Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_2_0e
----------------------------------------------------
Changes in this version:

1. Bug fix: SIG-27 - Edit assignment shows a blank screen.
2. Bug fix: SIG-26 - Detail window should be brought to the fore if already opened.
3. Replaced individual version-information files (README_<version>) with a
   NEWS.txt file (this file) to document changes.
4. Bug fix: SIG-25 - Details for first edit soon after creating an 
   assignment shows a false effective date change.

   signet_assignment, signet_proxy and parallel _history tables.

======================================== 
Signet  07/06/07

Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_2_0d
----------------------------------------------------
Changes in this version:

1. Bug fix: SIG-23 - Signet Utils do not have exec permissions in Linux build
2. Bug fix: SIG-22 - Incorrect Scopes are enabled when creating assignments
3. Performance improvemnt: Side-stepped previous changes to open/close 
    Hibernate Sessions for each DB transaction. Now a single Session is used
    but is closed/reopened when a user logs out. 
    This has enabled the ability to use Hibernate's lazy-loading feature for
    all DB objects.
    Eventually, I want to have one semi-permanent Session for DB reads, and one 
    or more transient Sessions for DB updates, inserts, deletes.
4. Replaced many hard-coded strings for accessing HTTP session params with
   statics defined in Constants.java.
5. Updated signet.userlibraries (Eclipse config file in DevGoodies)

======================================== 
Signet  04/27/07

Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_2_RC05
----------------------------------------------------
Changes in this version:

1. Added Linux QuickStart Demo scripts
2. Removed KITN.gif from standard signet build, included in QuickStart build
3. Replaced "osx" with "Mac OS X" in build_QS.xml
4. Determined that DB sequence vs. identity issues can be solved using the
    'native' generator for primary keys, if the 'sequence' parameter is
    always specified in the hibernate mapping files (*.hbm.xml).
5. Removed the autocommits from the utils (caused problem with Sybase) and
    replaced with explicit commits. (Note: May need to do the same for Signet
    main code as well.)
6. Fixed problem with HypersonicSQL DDL due to item 4, above. HSQLDB default
    behavior is to use 'identity'.

1. Modified utils to allow multiple command-line parameters:
    - '-q' option suppresses prompting user (used by QuickStart build)
    - multiple input files can be used on the command line for TreeXmlLoader,
      SubsystemXmlLoader, SubjectFileLoader
2. Fixed problems related to HypersonicSQL in TreeXmlLoader, SubsystemXmlLoader,
   SubjectFileLoader, SignetProxy
3. Fixed problem with Linux util/*/run.sh scripts: wrong BASEDIR
4. New Ant build script for QuickStart: build_QS.xml and buildSignet_QS.properties
    - automates the creation of the demo database
    - separate/different output directory than standard Ant build
    - fully-deployable ZIP and TGZ files generated
    - See "Still to Do", below
5. Fixed some bugs in Hibernate mapping files for Choice, ChoiceSet, Subsystem
6. Added independent automatic record ID generation to HSQL DDL ("dual_*")
7. Generation of Linux TAR files (JavaDocs, Sources, QuickStart) now creates a
   TAR with GZIP compression (file extension = .tgz) instead of a TAR contained
   within a GZIP (file extension = .gz).
8. Added method addSubsystem(Subsystem) to TreeImpl
9. Removed unused build.xml files from util/*, web
10. Fixed several private build targets that needed ${...}

Signet  02/26/07
Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_2_RC01

Changes in this version:

1. Release Candidate 01 incorporates all changes in the 1_1_TMPxx series.
======================================== 
Signet  02/26/07
Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_1_TMP09

Changes in this version:

1. Implemented use of DB sequences for primary key generation through Hibernate.


Still To Do:

1. Fix poor Hibernate/DB performance.

2. Write new unit tests that match the new architecture.

======================================== 
Signet  02/22/07
Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_1_TMP08

Changes in this version:

1. Changed the Hibernate session management architecture. The previous version
opened and used one Hibernate Session for the entire life of the application
(seriously frowned upon by Hibernate documentation). 
The new implementation opens a new Session (and Transaction) for each DB
interaction, then commits/closes after the transaction is complete. THIS HAS
CAUSED A TREMENDOUS SLOW-DOWN OF ALL DB ACCESS. I need to look into 
connection pooling (a Hibernate Session opens a DB connection behind the
scenes) to improve performance.
Another drawback to the new architecture is that I had to disable all of
Hibernates caching (*.hbm.xml now contain 'default_lazy="false"') which I'm
sure also contributes to the SLOW-DOWN. If lazy fetching is on (default in
Hibernate 3.2), the Session must remain open until the record is no longer
needed by the application. I couldn't find a clean way to manage Sessions, and
the records associated with them, carried throughout the application.

2. Changed (again!) the way SignetSubjectAttr handles multi-valued attributes.
Removed SignetSubjectAttrValue and added a 'sequence' field to
SignetSubjectAttr.

3. Did some performance tuning of ConfirmAction and ConfirmProxyAction to
allow for the optional, one-time, call to Grantable.checkEditAuthority for
_all_ field updates, instead of checking it for _every_ field update.

4. For all persistent records that have a modifyDatetime field, gave the
responsibility of keeping the value current to Hibernate by declaring the
field (in *.hbm.xml) as <timestamp... /> CAUTION: Hibernate has fits if the
application modifies this field directly, or through setModifyDatetime(...).
Don't call setModifyDatetime() or set the value internally; let Hibernate do it.

5. Most, if not all, JUnit test code is probably broken. All changes made were
only to get the code to compile. None of the unit tests were run to verify
whether they, or the application code, actually work.

Still To Do:

1. Fix poor Hibernate/DB performance.

2. Write new unit tests that match the new architecture.

======================================== 
Signet  01/16/07
Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_1_TMP07

Changes in this version:

1. Migrate from Hibernate 2.x to 3.2 (see Hibernate Migration Guide
  http://www.hibernate.org/250.html).

2. Removed unnecessary JARs from /lib. Signet.war went from 13.3 Mb to 7.2 Mb!!

3. Switched to commons-dbcp database connection pool manager

Still to do:

1. Fix bug where SignetSubjects retrieved from PersistedSignetSource
  (e.g. subj.getAssignmentsGranted()) had no runtime SubjectSource available
  for src.getSignet(), etc.

2. Change DB session management in HibernatDB.java. Currently one session is
used throughout the life of the app. We should be creating a new session for
each transaction.
======================================== 
Signet  01/08/07
Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_1_TMP06

1. Deleted unused classes:
   - ChoiceFullyQualifiedId
   - HtmlLimitRenderer
   - HtmlLimitRendererImpl
   - LimitShapeType
   - ValueTypeType

2. Modified the build files
   - renamed buildAltLocal.properties to buildCustom.properties
   - renamed properties with buildCustom.properties (and build.xml)

3. Renamed SignetSource.getParent() to getSources()

4. Added build_info.odg and .pdf to DevGoodies, an OpenOffice 2.1 presentation
  that describes the build process.

Still to do:

1. Fix bug where SignetSubjects retrieved from PersistedSignetSource
  (e.g. subj.getAssignmentsGranted()) had no runtime SubjectSource available
  for src.getSignet(), etc.

2. Migrate from Hibernate 2.x to 3.x (see Hibernate Migration Guide
  http://www.hibernate.org/250.html).

3. 


  ======================================== 
Signet  12/15/06
Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_1_TMP05

1. Modified the way Signet uses Hibernate for SignetSubject loading/saving.
SignetSubject used to contain Sets of references to Assignments granted/
received and Proxies granted/received. Those references have been removed and
replaced with live DB selects when the getAssignmentRecieved/Granted and
getProxiesReceived/Granted methods are called on SignetSubject.

2. Moved the Hibernate jars under the control of project i2mi-common. They
will now appear in the lib/i2mi-common directory when Signet project is
checked-out from CVS.


======================================== 
Signet  12/06/06
Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_1_TMP04 

1. Added i2mi-common jars to Signet's new lib/i2mi-common directory and buildSignet.properties.
2. Bumped signet_version to 1.1_TMP04 (file signet.properties).
3. EntityImpl.getSignet() is now public and not final.
4. Reconciler.reconcileGrantables() - reinstated setSignet().
5. Added logger to PersistedSignetSource, SignetAppSource, SignetJDBCSourceAdapter, SignetSources,
6. SignetSubject -
  a) fixed SIGNET_DESC
  b) reinstated setSignet in getAssignmentsGranted, getAssignmentsReceived, getProxiesGranted, getProxiesREceived and re-ordered methods
  c) added comments
7. priviledgesGrantedReport.jsp - fixed error with getting grantee. It was still using the old getSubjectType instead of getSourceId to retrieve a Subject.
======================================== 
Signet  11/22/06
Release Notes for CVS-tagged version 1.1.TMP03 

1. The 1.1.TMPnn series of checkins contain the new Signet internal architecture
   and new Signet API. This is still a work-in-progress, hence the TMPnn 
   designation. TMP03 does seem to be working in all areas but has not undergone
   rigorous testing.

2. The Signet build (build.xml, et. al.) has been modified as follows:
  a. Target 'production' no longer deploys signet.war to Tomcat. Target
     'development' still does, however.
  b. The 3 signet jar files (signet-api-x.x.x.jar, signet-ui-x.x.x.jar, and
     signet-util-x.x.x.jar) each contain manifest files with date and version
     information.
  c. subject-0.2.2-cvs.jar is assumed to reside in Signet's lib directory.
     It is checked-in to Signet's CVS and will be retrieved during a checkout.
     I had to make some changes to SubjectAPI and felt that, for the short-
     term, it would be better to not have inter-project dependencies.
  d. The Signet project does depend on the i2mi-common project, which is a
     collection of 3rd party libraries. There's nothing to build, just check
     it out from CVS before building Signet. Depending on where you put
     i2mi-common, you may need to change the build variable
     'i2mi_common_lib.dir' defined in file buildSignet.properties.
  e. Any build.xml files, other than signet/build.xml, are probably obsolete
     and may not work.

3. Signet's persistent store (database) has changed as follows:
  a. Two new tables have been added: Signet_SubjectAttribute and
     Signet_SubjectAttrValue. These provide the ability to store multiple
     values per attribute. For instance, a Person having two login IDs will
     only have one row in Signet_Subject, one row in Signet_SubjectAttribute,
     and two rows in Signet_SubjectAttrValue.
  b. NOTE!! ONLY POSTGRES.SQL IS CURRENT. THE OTHER DDL FILES ARE NOT CURRENT
     AND WILL NOT WORK. I will try to update them as time permits.
  c. It was discovered during development that Hibernate (the Object Relational
     Mapping (ORM) tool Signet uses) ignores the Sequences we defined for
     various primary keys. Instead, Hibernate uses it's own Sequence -
     'hibernate_sequence' exclusively for _all_ primary keys. I'm not sure if
     this occurs only in Postgres or is systemic. More on this later.
  d. Several tables with foreign keys to signet_subject were modified to use
     long (int8) values.
  e. Added Postgres JAR and licence files to CVS.

4. The User Interface was modified to accomodate the new architecture and to
   also use the new Signet API. Also, some syntax errors were corrected in
   the JSPs.

5. The Eclipse IDE project was modified as follows:
   a. Note: if you're a 'command-line kinda person' you can skip this.
   b. I created several 'User Libraries' to manage the numerous JAR files
      that Signet depends on. User Libraries are a convenient way of grouping
      files under a single handle. You can define your own in any one of 
      several ways. If you want to know how, drop me an e-mail. I created an
      XML and readme in Signet/DevGoodies/Eclipse_IDE/. You'll get these files
      the next time you checkout or update from CVS.

6. Signet Utilities (TreeXmlLoader, SubsystemXmlLoader, SubjectFileLoader, and
   SignetProxy)
   a. I created a DOS (okay, Windows) batch file that will make setting the
      CLASSPATH a little easier. Each of the utilities' run.bat files calls
      util\dist-signet_cp.bat to set the CLASSPATH prior to running the
      utility. YOU MAY NEED TO CHANGE THE SIGNET_LIBS VARIABLE to have it
      work properly with your installation.
   b. I'll try to keep this file current with subsequent Signet releases. But if
      things suddenly stop working, this is one place to check for problems.
   c. For Linux/Unix users, the CLASSPATH is still created dynamically. So, the
      above-mentioned problems are not an issue.
