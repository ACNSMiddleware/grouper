SignetXml [options] command [command-args]

    options
       * -c[=commandFile] : read commands from the specified file. Each line in
            the file corresponds to a separate command (i.e. export, append,
            or import). If no commandFile is specified, stdin is used. All
            options and commands following -c are ignored.
        -v : display program version information and exit.
        -h or -? : display this help and exit.

    command
        export[=xmlFilename] : create an XML containing values as specified in
            command-args. Overwrites xmlFilename if it already exists. If
            xmlFilename is not specified, stdout is used.
        append[=xmlFilename] : create an XML containing values as specified in
            command-args. Appends to xmlFilename if it already exists. If
            xmlFilename is not specified, stdout is used.
        import[=xmlFilename] : read an XML and perform action(s) specified in
            command-args. If xmlFilename is not specified, stdin is used.

        subjId="subj 1, subj2, ..., subject n" : selects permissions for each
            subject in the comma-separated list

    'export scopeTree' command-args
        <null> : if no command-arg is specified, export all scopeTrees

        scopeId="tree id" : selects scope tree for the given tree Id
        scopeId="TreeId1, TreeId2, ..., TreeIdN" : selects all scope trees for
            each tree Id in the comma-separated list

        subsysId="subsystemId" : selects scope trees for the given subsystem id
        subsysId="subsystem1, subsystem2, ... subsystemN" : selects all
            scope trees matching subsystem ids in the comma-separated list
		
    'export subject' command-args
        <null> : if no command arg is specified, export all subjects

        subjId="sourceId:subjectId" : select subject for the given source and
            subjectId
        subjId="source1:subj1, source2:subj2, ..." : selects each subject in
            the comma-separated list

        source="sourceId" : selects all subjects for the given sourceId
        source="source1, source2, ..." : selects all subjects for each of the
            sources specified in the comma-separated list

        attrName=attrValue : selects all subjects having an attribute
            matching both the attribute name and attribute value. 

    'export subsystem' command-args
        status=[active | inactive | pending] : filter selected subsystems by
            status. Default is all. May be used with 'name' 'scopeId'
            or 'subsysId' (which are mutually exclusive).

        name="SubsysName" : selects subsystem for specified name
        name="Subsys1, Subsys2, ..." : selects all subsystems matching
            subsystem names in the comma-separated list

        scopeId="tree id" : selects subsystem(s) for the given tree Id
        scopeId="TreeId1, TreeId2, ..., TreeIdN" : selects all scope trees
            matching tree Id in the comma-separated list

            subsystems matching subsystem ids in the comma-separated list

    'import'* command-args
        add | update | deactivate | delete

  Examples:

  SignetXml export=MyAssigns.xml assignment subjId="Arthur Dent" status=active
    Create, or overwrite, a file called MyAssigns.xml containing all active
    Assignments belonging to Arthur Dent.

  SignetXml export=JpFdSa.xml assignment subjId="jpoole, fdewey, susan.albright"
    Create, or overwrite, a file called JpFdSa.xml containing any Assignments
    granted to Jean Poole, Francis Dewey, or Susan Albright. Note the use of
    double-quotes to contain the subjId command-arg because the comma-
    separated list contains spaces.

  SignetXml export=AsgnByFunc.xml assignment functionId="projectx:purchase-supplies"
    Export all Assignments within the procjectx subsystem for the function
    purchase-supplies.

  SignetXml import=MyAssigns.xml add
