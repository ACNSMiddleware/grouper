SignetXml [options] command [command-args]

    options
       * -c[=commandFile] : read commands from the specified file. Each line in
            the file corresponds to a separate command (i.e. export, append,
            or import). If no commandFile is specified, stdin is used. All
            options and commands following -c are ignored.
        -v : display program version information and exit.
        -h or -? : display this help and exit.

    command
        export[=xmlFilename] : create an XML containing values as specified in
            command-args. Overwrites xmlFilename if it already exists. If
            xmlFilename is not specified, stdout is used.
        append[=xmlFilename] : create an XML containing values as specified in
            command-args. Appends to xmlFilename if it already exists. If
            xmlFilename is not specified, stdout is used.
        import[=xmlFilename] : read an XML and perform action(s) specified in
            command-args. If xmlFilename is not specified, stdin is used.

    'export' command-args
        assignment | permission* | proxy* | scopeTree* | subject* | subsystem*

    'export assignment' command-args
        status=[active | inactive | pending] : filter selected assignments by
            status. Default is all. May be used with 'subjId' 'scopeId' or
            'functionId' (which are mutually exclusive).

        subjId="subject Id" : selects assignments for specified subject
        subjId*=all : selects assignments for all subjects (default)
        subjId="subj 1, subj2, ..., subject n" : selects assignments for each
            subject in the comma-separated list

        scopeId*="scope Id" : selects all assignments for given scope
        scopeId*="scope Id 1, scope id 2, scope id n, ..." : selects assignments
            for each scope in the comma-separated list
         
        functionId*="function Id" : selects all assignments for a given function
        functionId*="func 1, func2, func n, ..." : selects assignments for each
            specified function in the comma-separated list

	'export permission'* command-args

	'export proxy'* command-args

	'export scopeTree'* command-args
		treeId="tree id"
		treeId=all
		subsystemId="subsystem id"
		functionId="function id"

    'export subject'* command-args

    'export proxy'* command-args

    'import'* command-args
        add | update | deactivate | delete

  Examples:

  SignetXml export=MyAssigns.xml assignment subjId="Arthur Dent" status=active
    Create, or overwrite, a file called MyAssigns.xml containing all active
    Assignments belonging to Arthur Dent.

  SignetXml export=JpFdSa.xml assignment subjId="jpoole, fdewey, susan.albright"
    Create, or overwrite, a file called JpFdSa.xml containing any Assignments
    granted to Jean Poole, Francis Dewey, or Susan Albright. Note the use of
    double-quotes to contain the subjId command-arg because the comma-
    separated list contains spaces.

  SignetXml import=MyAssigns.xml add
    Import the contents of file MyAssigns.xml and add them to the Signet
    database. Do not overwrite records that have primary keys that match the
    imported records.
