Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_2_0b
----------------------------------------------------
Changes in this version:

1. Bug fix: SIG-23 - Signet Utils do not have exec permissions in Linux build
2. Bug fix: SIG-22 - Incorrect Scopes are enabled when creating assignments
3. Performance improvemnt: Side-stepped previous changes to open/close 
    Hibernate Sessions for each DB transaction. Now a single Session is used
    but is closed/reopened when a user logs out. 
    This has enabled the ability to use Hibernate's lazy-loading feature for
    all DB objects.
    Eventually, I want to have one semi-permanent Session for DB reads, and one 
    or more transient Sessions for DB updates, inserts, deletes.
