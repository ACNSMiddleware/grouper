Release Notes for CVS-tagged version Signet_1_3_0rc02

1. Bug fixes:
    SIG-32 : NullPointerException from "View XML" link
    SIG-33 : Proxy data not in Assignment XML
    SIG-34 : Assignment XML should support container structure
    SIG-35 : NullPointerException throw on export scopeTree
    SIG-36 : Scope Tree XML should support container structure
    SIG-38 : A command-arg that contains multiple colon delimiters fails to be processed
    SIG-39 : SignetXML creates an output file called 'stdout.xml' when no xmlFilename is provided

2. Added new method:
        HibernateDB.getProxies(String status)
   Added new members:
        HibernateQry.Qry_proxiesAll
        HibernateQry.Qry_proxiesByStatus

3. Made the command-line command parser case-insensitive

4. Removed Command.java and split it into CommandArg.java and CommandOptions.java

5. The various XML processors (e.g. AssignmentXml, PermissionXml, ScopeTreeXml,
   SubjectXml, SubsystemXml) now require a SignetXa instance instead of a
   Signet instance.

6. Changed the way SignetXml processes commands. The marshalling of XML used to
   occur in the various XML processors (see item 5, above). This prevented the
   ability to process multiple commands for a single output file. Now the
   marshalling occurs in SignetXml after all commands have been processed.

7. Updated commandHelp.txt to reflect the new command-line syntax.

8. The JavaDocs now contain references to classes in package
    edu.internet2.middleware.signet.util.xml
