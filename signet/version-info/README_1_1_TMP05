Signet  12/15/06
Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_1_TMP05

1. Modified the way Signet uses Hibernate for SignetSubject loading/saving.
SignetSubject used to contain Sets of references to Assignments granted/
received and Proxies granted/received. Those references have been removed and
replaced with live DB selects when the getAssignmentRecieved/Granted and
getProxiesReceived/Granted methods are called on SignetSubject.

2. Moved the Hibernate jars under the control of project i2mi-common. They
will now appear in the lib/i2mi-common directory when Signet project is
checked-out from CVS.
