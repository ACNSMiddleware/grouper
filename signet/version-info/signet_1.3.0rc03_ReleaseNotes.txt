Release Notes for CVS-tagged version Signet_1_3_0rc03

1. Bug fixes:
    Sig-32 : NullPointerException from "View XML" link

2. In SignetXml, an ObjectNotFoundException was being thrown if a query
    resulted in no rows found (e.g. signetxml export scopeTree -scopeId foobar). 
    In addition, the query would return an uninitialized object (e.g.
    TreeImpl, with all fields set to null) instead of returning a null.

3. API changes:
    a. removed "throws ObjectNotFoundException" from the load(...) methods in
        HibernateDB.java
    b. added new method: HibernateDB.getPermissionById(int permKey)

4. Updated SignetXml/commandHelp.txt to show that the absense of a filter
    on the "export subsystem" command is a valid option (i.e. returns all
    subsystems).

5. Resource-ified three error messages in HibernateDB.java.
