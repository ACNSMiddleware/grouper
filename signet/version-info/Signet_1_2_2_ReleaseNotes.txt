Signet 1.2.2 Release Notes - 08/14/07

Signet 1.2.2 is now available. The following is a summary of the changes
since the previous version, catagorized by functional area.

New Features
------------

1.  New Feature (per Michael Gettes' request) - Ability to specify the default
    Privilege type selection in the UI. See comments in
    /signet/config/signetResUi.properties for more information.

2.  Added History record creation when editing a Proxy. None was created before.

3.  Added Subject AuthId tooltip (mouseover) to Subject Search result list
    in the user interface


Environment
-----------

1. Minor changes to the build processes were made to accomodate Apple's OSX.
   Users of OSX are encouraged to upgrade to Ant version 1.7.x if they intend
   to build Signet (either the standard build or the QuickStart build).
   Users of other operating systems may continue to use Ant 1.6.x. The
   standalone (command-line) Ant 1.7.0 is currently available at
       http://ant.apache.org
   However, the most recent Eclipse IDE Ant plugin is still 1.6.5. It is not
   known whether other IDEs have upgraded to the most recent Ant.

2. Upgraded to commons-lang-2.0.jar (also added to project i2mi-common and
    created tag I2MI-COMMON_0_4_0)

3. Upgraded to SubjectAPI lib subject-0.3.0-rc1-cvs (same as that used by 
   Grouper).

4. Items 2 and 3, above, bring Signet closer to Grouper's use of 3rd-party
   libraries. The most signicant difference is that Signet is currently using
   Hibernate 3.2 while Grouper is using 2.6(?).


API
---

1. Added new method to class SignetSubject:
     public boolean sameAs(SignetSubject subject)
   Essentially, performs the same operations that the old equals(SignetSubject)
   did (see next item).

2. Modified method SignetSubject.equals(SignetSubject subject). This method
   now includes field synchDatetime in the comparison.

3. Standardization of Date object creation throughout the application. Now
   Calendar is used exclusively to get the current Date and/or Time. Also,
   java.util.Date is used throughout (there were some spurious uses of
   java.sql.Date).

4. Deleted unused class ExternalSubjectId.java

5. Added Java Generics to several classes related to SignetSubject (will be
    adding more as they are encountered)

6. SignetJDBCSourceAdapter now retrieves SignetSubjectAttr records ordered by
    name and instance fields. Ordering was being performed in the Java code
    but is now unnecessary with the addition of an 'order by' clause.


Database
--------

1. SignetSubject.hbm.xml erroneously declared synchDatetime as 'date' type
    instead of 'timestamp' type (no bug filed)


Bug Fixes
---------

1.  Bugfix SIG-29: "The current choice of privDisplayType is not reserved when
    clicking on any privilige"

2.  Bugfix (not filed) - A logged-in user would occasionally show as "acting as"
    themselves (e.g. jpoole logged in, not acting as anyone else, display would
    show "Poole, Jean acting as Poole, Jean").

3.  Fixed problem (no bug filed) where the output lib directory was not getting
    a complete set of JARs with Ant 1.7 (versus Ant 1.6.x).

4.  CR/LF issue (in the util scripts) with Mac OSX in Ant 1.6.x is fixed by
    upgrading to Ant 1.7.0 (no bug filed).

5.  Bugfix SIG-31 - Null ptr exception when modifying the duration / end-date
    of a Proxy

6.  Subject resynchronization (from original Source, see subjectSources.xml
    "latencyMinutes" property) was not working properly (no bug filed)

7.  Date range during Proxy create/edit was not being validated (no bug filed)

8. Attribute copy (during SignetSubject synch/resynch) should create copy
    of attributes, not use references (no bug filed)

9. Standardized, cleaned up algorithm for date checking in ConfirmAction and
    ConfirmProxyAction.

10. Bugfix SIG-30 - Subject search fails on Sybase

11. Fixed JavaDoc warning message in SignetSubject.java
