Changes from CVS tags SIGNET_1_3_0 to SIGNET_1_3_1

Release Notes for CVS-tagged version Signet_1_3_1
--------------------------------------------------

1. Added checks for null in several classes

2. Upgraded to Subject API 0.4.1. This required inclusion of grouper's
morphString.jar. Subject-0.4.1 changes the way DB connections occur.
MorphString allows passwords in property files to be encrypted, then decrypted
at runtime.

3. Changed the format of the log4j messages to be consistent and more
informative.

4. Moved Xml Adapter and Binder classes out of signet-util.jar (they're
already in their own jars).
