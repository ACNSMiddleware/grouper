Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_1_TMP06

1. Deleted unused classes:
   - ChoiceFullyQualifiedId
   - HtmlLimitRenderer
   - HtmlLimitRendererImpl
   - LimitShapeType
   - ValueTypeType

2. Modified the build files
   - renamed buildAltLocal.properties to buildCustom.properties
   - renamed properties with buildCustom.properties (and build.xml)

3. Renamed SignetSource.getParent() to getSources()

4. Added build_info.odg and .pdf to DevGoodies, an OpenOffice 2.1 presentation
  that describes the build process.

Still to do:

1. Fix bug where SignetSubjects retrieved from PersistedSignetSource
  (e.g. subj.getAssignmentsGranted()) had no runtime SubjectSource available
  for src.getSignet(), etc.

2. Migrate from Hibernate 2.x to 3.x (see Hibernate Migration Guide
  http://www.hibernate.org/250.html).

3.
