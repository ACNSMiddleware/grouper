Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_2_RC05
----------------------------------------------------
Changes in this version:

1. Added Linux QuickStart Demo scripts
2. Removed KITN.gif from standard signet build, included in QuickStart build
3. Replaced "osx" with "Max OS X" in build_QS.xml
4. Determined that DB sequence vs. identity issues can be solved using the
    'native' generator for primary keys, if the 'sequence' parameter is
    always specified in the hibernate mapping files (*.hbm.xml).
5. Removed the autocommits from the utils (caused problem with Sybase) and
    replaced with explicit commits. (Note: May need to do the same for Signet
    main code as well.)
