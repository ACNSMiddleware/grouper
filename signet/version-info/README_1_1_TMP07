Signet  01/16/07
Release Notes for CVS-tagged version SIGNET_1_1_TMP07

Changes in this version:

1. Migrate from Hibernate 2.x to 3.2 (see Hibernate Migration Guide
  http://www.hibernate.org/250.html).

2. Removed unnecessary JARs from /lib. Signet.war went from 13.3 Mb to 7.2 Mb!!

3. Switched to commons-dbcp database connection pool manager

Still to do:

1. Fix bug where SignetSubjects retrieved from PersistedSignetSource
  (e.g. subj.getAssignmentsGranted()) had no runtime SubjectSource available
  for src.getSignet(), etc.

2. Change DB session management in HibernatDB.java. Currently one session is
used throughout the life of the app. We should be creating a new session for
each transaction.
