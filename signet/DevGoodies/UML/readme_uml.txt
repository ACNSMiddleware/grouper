Signet UML Diagram Readme File
------------------------------

The *.jude file(s) contained in the UML directory were produced using the
community version of Jude, a UML modelling tool from Change-Vision, Inc.
(http://jude.change-vision.com/jude-web/index.html). Jude/Community is free,
as of this writing.

The diagrams were produced by reverse engineering the Signet Java source files.
However, the export and print capabilities of Jude/Community are somewhat
limited. The *.jpg files found here were produced by selecting all diagram
components, copying them to the clipboard, and pasting them into a bitmap
editing program. Not very efficient but it gets the job done.
