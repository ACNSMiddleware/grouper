    SignetXml Adapter classes. These classes provide an adapter layer between
    the Signet runtime classes and the SignetXml binder classes. The binder
    classes are generated from the Signet XML schema document, using the JAXB
    utility 'xjc'. The Signet schema document is generated by the JAXB utility
    'schemagen' from stub Java classes.
    <p>
    The Adapter classes are designed so that their constructors take either a
    Signet class or a Binder class and can return the other class with a call
    to the appropriate getter method.
