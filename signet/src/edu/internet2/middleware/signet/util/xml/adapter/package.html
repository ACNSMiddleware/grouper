    SignetXml Adapter classes. These classes provide an adapter layer between
    the Signet runtime classes and the SignetXml binder classes. The binder
    classes are generated from the Signet XML schema document, using the JAXB
    utility 'xjc'. The Signet schema document is generated by the JAXB utility
    'schemagen' from stub Java classes.
