    Signet is a privilege management service that provides centralized management of user privileges across a range of applications. Core middleware services such as identity management, directory, and authentication provide a foundation for secure, manageable applications throughout an institution. Even with this foundation, as systems and applications proliferate it becomes more and more difficult to manage user access consistently and cost-effectively. A privilege management service is a relatively new component of campus middleware that addresses this problem by providing centralized management of user privileges across a range of applications.

	The benefits of this service include:
	<p style="padding-left: 0.25in">
	* A standard user interface for privilege administrators<br>
	* Consistent, simplified policy definition, via roles and integration with core campus organizational data<br>
	* Improved visibility, understandability, and auditability of privilege information<br>
	* Standard interfaces to other infrastructure services and to application systems to support integration.
	</p>
	Leading-edge development and use of privilege management systems at some campuses have both proven the feasibility of these systems and provided valuable understanding of technical and organizational prerequisites. The Signet Project intends to build on these successes to permit more institutions to take advantage of this useful service.
