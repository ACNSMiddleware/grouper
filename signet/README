Signet release 1.3.0

There are two Signet distributions available for download. Both distributions
are available in tar (Linux/Unix/OSX) and zip (Windows) formats. An MD5
checksum file is also available for all files.

    https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/SignetWG/Software+Download

1.  The Signet QuickStart is a fully-functional demo which includes Signet,
    Apache Tomcat, and HypersonicSQL. Download either signet-qs-1.3.0.zip or
    signet-qs-1.3.0rc01.tgz.
2.  The standard Signet distribution is a snapshot of the CVS repository. This
    distribution includes all source code, 3rd-party libraries, Ant build files,
    and Eclipse IDE project. Download either signet-dist-1.3.0.zip or
    signet-dist-1.3.0.tgz.


To use the QuickStart distribution
----------------------------------

1.  Unpack the .tgz or .zip file. Open a command-line window and change to the
    directory signet-qs-1.3.0/demo.
2.  If you currently have a running instance of either Apache Tomcat and/or
    HypersonicSQL you must stop (but not uninstall!) both.
3.  If you are running under Windows, type 'start_demo.bat' at the command-line.
4.  If you are running Linux/Unix/OSX, type './start_demo.sh' at the command-
    line.
5.  Step 3 or 4 will start the HypersonicSQL database and Tomcat, and finally
    open your system's default web browser pointed to Signet.
6.  When you are finished running the demo, run the appropriate shutdown script
    (shutdown_demo.bat or ./shutdown_demo.sh).


To deploy the "regular", "non-quickstart" Signet web application
----------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Unpack .tgz or .zip file.
2.  Execute the appropriate DDL (found in signet/sql/) on your database server
    to create the Signet database.
3.  Copy your JDBC driver to signet/lib.
4.  Configure your database connection by editing signet/buildSignet.properties.
    Some sample configuration settings appear as comments near the bottom of
    this file.
    At least 5 values must be set: db.cfg.dialect, db.cfg.driver, db.cfg.url,
    db.cfg.username, and db.cfg.password.
    Four additional values may be set if you intend to use Signet's SubjectAPI
    database adapter: db.cfg.driver.subjapi, db.cfg.url.subjapi,
    db.cfg.username.subjapi, db.cfg.password.subjapi.
5.  Set your preferred hibernate logging level by editing
    signet/config/log4j.properties.
6.  Change the feedback href footer.feedback.href in
    signet/config/signetResUi.properties to point to your preferred email
    address.
7.  Change the organizational logo value in header.logo.image in
    signet/config/signetResUi.properties to point to your preferred logo file.
8.  To populate your Signet application with the sample demo-system data:
  (1) Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location of your JDK
      (a Java runtime environment, JRE, won't do).
  (2) Load your data or sample data provided using a run.sh (unix/Mac) or
      run.bat script (Windows) as follows:
      Organization tree -- util/TreeXmlLoader/
      > run.sh demo_tree.xml
      Subsystem definitions -- util/SubsystemXmlLoader/
      > run.sh demo_biox_subsystem.xml
      > run.sh demo_library_subsystem.xml
      Subject data -- util/SubjectFileLoader/
      > run.sh demo_subject.txt
  (3) If you're using any authentication mechanism other than the demonstration
      mechanism that comes with Signet, add login-names to your web server's
      authentication mechanism, with any passwords you like. Login names must
      correspond to the principal identifier (e.g., "jpoole" in the sample data)
      of one or more Subjects loaded above.
  (4) Establish System Administrator and Subsystem Owner roles. Use the
      util/SignetProxy/run.sh script to designate online System
      Administrator(s). The script takes two arguments:
          1 - Action to take -- grant | revoke | list
          2 - For grant or revoke, a login ID from the subject table
      For example, to make sample subject Kai Martinez a System Administrator:
          > run.sh grant kmart
  (5) The System Administrator can log into the UI, "act for" Signet, and use
      the Designated Driver feature to enable others to proxy Signet for an
      individual subsystem.  These people are the "Subsystem Owners" and can
      do all initial granting of any privileges for that subsystem. 
9.  If you want to change Signet's version and output directory/zip file names,
    edit signet_version and signet_basename insignet/config/signet.properties.
10. If you want to provide additional functionality or override default settings
    using Signet's "doppleganger" build/runtime configuration, please refer to
    the Signet wiki Product page
        https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/SignetWG/Signet+Product
    and look at the various pages under "Building Signet".
11. Details on running the build, either from a command-line or using Eclipse,
    are also available from the same wiki page.
