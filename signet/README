Signet is distributed in two forms: A "regular" distribution, which can be
configured according to your own needs, and a "quickstart" distribution,
which provides a pre-configured Signet web application, complete with Tomcat
server and an HSQLDB database pre-populated with metadata, subjects and
assignments. The "quickstart" distribution is much easier to get started with.

Here is a summary installation guide.  Please see the website for more
detailed instructions.

To use the "quickstart" distribution:
-------------------------------------

(1) Unpack the signet-qs-1.0-bin.tar.gz file if you're using Unix (including
    Mac), or the signet-qs-1.0-bin.zip file, if you're using Windows.

(2) Navigate into the resulting signet-qs-1.0/demo directory.

(3) Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location of your JDK. Note
    that it must point to a JDK - a JRE is not sufficient.

(4) Go to the signet-qs-1.0/demo directory and run the "startup.sh" script
    (Unix/Mac), or the "startup.bat" script (Windows).

(5) After waiting a few moments for Tomcat to start up, you should be
    able to connect to your own personal Signet instance, at this URL:

      http://localhost:8080/signet

(6) When you're finished using your Signet instance, run the "shutdown.sh"
    script (Unix/Mac), or the "shutdown.bat" script (Windows).


To deploy the "regular", "non-quickstart" Signet web application:
-------------------------------------

(1) Unpack the signet-1.0-bin.tar.gz file (Unix/Mac),
    or the signet-1.0-bin.zip file (Windows).

(2) Execute the appropriate DDL (found in signet/sql/) on your database server
    to create the Signet database.

(3) Copy your JDBC driver to two directories: webapp/signet/WEB-INF/lib (for
    use by the Web application) and lib (for use by the utility programs).

(4) Configure your database connection:
    - edit the config/hibernate.cfg.xml file to set the connection parameters
    - copy this edited file to webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/hibernate.cfg.xml

(5) Set your preferred hibernate logging level
    - edit the config/log4j.properties file
    - copy this edited file to webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties

(6) Change the feedback href (@FEEDBACK_URL@) in webapp/signet/tiles/footer.jsp
    to point to your preferred email address.
    
(7) Replace webapp/signet/images/site-logo.gif with an organizational logo of
    your choice.

(8) If you are using the
    local subject adapter, set its database connection parameters:
    - edit the config/sources.xml file
    - copy this edited file to webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/sources.xml

(9) Point the web application context to the webapp/signet directory in this
    distribution.

To populate your Signet application with the sample demo-system data:

  (1) Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location of your JDK.
        
  (2) Load your data or sample data provided using a run.sh (unix/Mac) or
      run.bat script (Windows) as follows:

      Organization tree -- util/TreeXmlLoader/
      > run.sh demo_tree.xml

      Subsystem definitions -- util/SubsystemXmlLoader/
      > run.sh demo_biox_subsystem.xml
      > run.sh demo_library_subsystem.xml

      Subject data -- util/SubjectFileLoader/
      > run.sh demo_subject.txt

  (3) If you're using any authentication mechanism other than the demonstration
      mechanism that comes with Signet, add login-names to your web server's
      authentication mechanism, with any passwords you like. Login names must
      correspond to the principal identifier (e.g., "jpoole" in the sample data)
      of one or more Subjects loaded above.

  (4) Establish System Administrator and Subsystem Owner roles. Use the
      util/SignetProxy/run.sh script to designate online System
      Administrator(s). The script takes two arguments:
        
          1 - Action to take -- grant | revoke | list
          2 - For grant or revoke, a login ID from the subject table
          
      For example, to make sample subject Kai Martinez a System Administrator:
      
          > run.sh grant kmart
          
  (5) The System Administrator can log into the UI, "act for" Signet, and use
      the Designated Driver feature to enable others to proxy Signet for an
      individual subsystem.  These people are the "Subsystem Owners" and can
      do all initial granting of any privileges for that subsystem.
