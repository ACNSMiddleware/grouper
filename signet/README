What's New
----------

Support for Limits.
SubsystemXmlLoader utility to input a Subsystem definition via an XML document.
SubsystemDestroyer utility for cleanup.


Quick Start
------------------------

(1) Execute the DDL (sql/hsql.sql or sql/sybase.sql) on your database server to create the Signet database.
(2) Create a "signet" web application context in your servlet container.
(3) Point the web application context to the webapp/signet directory in this distribution.
(4) Copy your JDBC driver to the webapp/signet/WEB-INF/lib directory.
(5) Configure your database connection in two places: webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/hibernate.cfg.xml and util/classes/hibernate.cfg.xml. Uncomment or add a database section and set the connection parameters (@DB_URL@, @DB_USERNAME@, @DB_PASSWORD@).
(6) Set your preferred hibernate logging level in webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties and util/classes/log4j.properties.
(7) Change the feedback href (@FEEDBACK_URL@) in webapp/signet/footer.jsp to point to your preferred email address.
(8) Note: if you are using Tomcat for authenticating users, you will need to add them to your conf/tomcat-users.xml file.  These users will need to be the same as the subject IDs of users identified as Subjects within Signet.

To populate the Signet demo application with sample data:
(1) Update the sample shell script util/subsystemloader/run.sh to point JAVA_HOME to the location of your JDK.
(2) Use the SubsystemXmlLoader to create the demo sample Subsystem by executing the util/subsystemloader/run.sh script with the sample demo/Subsystem.xml file, e.g., > run.sh ../../demo/data/Subsystem.xml
(3) Execute the sql/subject.sql script to load the sample person data.
(4) Execute the sql/tree.sql script to load the sample organization tree data.
(5) Add the following login-names to your web server's authentication mechanism, with any passwords you like. This will allow you to log in to Signet as any Signet subject.
