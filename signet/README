Signet version 1.0 - February, 2006

What's New
----------
    
Signet is distributed in two forms: A "regular" distribution, which can be
configured according to your own needs, and a "quickstart" distribution,
which provides a pre-configured Signet web application, complete with Tomcat
server and pre-populated HSQLDB database. The "quickstart" distribution is
much easier to get started with.

To use the "quickstart" distribution:
------------------------

(1) Unpack the signet-qs-1.0-bin.tar.gz file if you're using Unix (including
    Mac), or the signet-qs-1.0-bin.zip file, if you're using Windows.

(2) Navigate into the resulting signet-qs-1.0/demo directory.

(3) Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location of your JDK. Note
    that it must point to a JDK - a JRE is not sufficient.

(4) Run the "startup.sh" script, if you're using Unix (including Mac), or
    the "startup.bat" script, if you're using Windows.

(5) After waiting a few moments for Tomcat to start up, you should be
    able to connect to your own personal Signet instance, at this URL:

      http://localhost:8080/signet

(6) When you're finished using your Signet instance, run the "shutdown.sh"
    script, if you're using Unix (including Mac), or the "shutdown.bat"
    script, if you're using Windows.

To deploy the "regular", "non-quickstart" Signet web application:
------------------------

(1) Unpack the signet-1.0-bin.tar.gz file if you're using Unix (including
    Mac), or the signet-1.0-bin.zip file, if you're using Windows.

(2) Execute the DDL (sql/hsql.sql or sql/sybase.sql) on your database server to
    create the Signet database.

(3) Copy your JDBC driver to two directories: webapp/signet/WEB-INF/lib (for
    use by the Web application) and lib (for use by the utility programs).

(4) Configure your database connection by editing the config/hibernate.cfg.xml
    file. Set the connection parameters (hibernate.dialect,
    hibernate.connection.driver_class, hibernate.connection.url,
    hibernate.connection.username, and hibernate.connection.password).
    Copy this edited file to webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/hibernate.cfg.xml.

(5) Set your preferred hibernate logging level by editing the
    config/log4j.properties file. Copy this edited file to
    webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties.

(6) Change the feedback href (@FEEDBACK_URL@) in webapp/signet/tiles/footer.jsp
    to point to your preferred email address.
    
(7) Replace the organization logo in webapp/signet/images/site-logo.gif with
    an image of your choice.

(8) Configure your subject sources in config/sources.xml. If you are using the
    local subject adapter, add or uncomment a database section, and set the
    database connection parameters (@DB_DRIVER@, @DB_URL@, @DB_USERNAME@, and
    @DB_PASSWORD@). Copy this edited file to
    webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/sources.xml.

(9) Point the web application context to the webapp/signet directory in this
    distribution.

To populate the Signet demo application with sample data:

  (1) Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location of your JDK.
        
  (2) Load the sample organization-tree data:
    Use the TreeXMLLoader to create the demo sample organization-tree
    by executing the util/TreeXmlLoader/run.sh script with the sample
    demo_tree.xml file, e.g.,
      > run.sh demo_tree.xml

  (3) Load the sample Subsystem data:
    Use the SubsystemXmlLoader to create the demo sample Subsystem by
    executing the util/SubsystemXmlLoader/run.sh script with the sample
    demo_subsystem.xml file, e.g.,
      > run.sh demo_biox_subsystem.xml
      > run.sh demo_library_subsystem.xml

  (4) Load the sample Subject data:
    (a) Modify the util/SubjectFileLoader/demo_subject.txt file with any
        additional local Subject identities for your site.
    (b) Use the SubjectFileLoader to load that sample person data by
        executing the util/SubjectFileLoader/run.sh script with the sample
        demo_subject.txt file, e.g.,
          > run.sh demo_subject.txt

  (5) If you're using any authentication mechanism other than the demonstration
      mechanism that comes with Signet, add login-names to your web server's
      authentication mechanism, with any passwords you like. Login names must
      correspond to the principal identifier (e.g., "demo" in the sample data)
      of one or more Subjects loaded above.

  (6) Establish System Administrator and Subsystem Owner roles. Use the
      util/SignetProxy/run.sh script to designate online System
      Administrator(s). The script takes two arguments:
        
          1 - Action to take -- grant | revoke | list
          2 - For grant or revoke, a login ID from the subject table
          
      For example, this command designates Lynn McRae as a System Administrator:
      
          > run.sh grant lmcrae
          
      Someone designated thusly as a System Administrator can log into the UI,
      "act for" Signet (the control to switch identities is on the right of
      the main interface page), an use the Designated Driver feature to 
      enable others to proxy Signet for an individual subsystem.  These people
      are the "Subsystem Owners" and can do all initial granting of any
      privileges for that subsystem.
