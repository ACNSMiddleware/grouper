Signet version 0.2 - March, 2005

What's New
----------

SubjectFileLoader utility to input a set of Subject definitions via an XML document.
Page-headers and page-footers in the Signet GUI are now defined as Tiles, for easier site-specific customization.
Limit-values are now taken into account when creating and revoking assignments:
  Limit-values that are not assignable in a given context are now dimmed in the GUI.
  Assignments that are not revocable in a given context now have their "revoke"
  checkboxes dimmed.
Person-search in the GUI now returns only those names which match the search-string.
  This functionality is compatible with Windows IE, Windows Firefox, Mac Safari,
  and Mac Firefox.
  


Quick Start
------------------------

(1) Execute the DDL (sql/hsql.sql or sql/sybase.sql) on your database server to create the Signet database.
(2) Create a "signet" web application context in your servlet container.
(3) Point the web application context to the webapp/signet directory in this distribution.
(4) Copy your JDBC driver to the webapp/signet/WEB-INF/lib directory.
(5) Configure your database connection in two places: webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/hibernate.cfg.xml and util/classes/hibernate.cfg.xml. Uncomment or add a database section and set the connection parameters (@DB_URL@, @DB_USERNAME@, @DB_PASSWORD@).
(6) Set your preferred hibernate logging level in webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties and util/classes/log4j.properties.
(7) Change the feedback href (@FEEDBACK_URL@) in webapp/signet/footer.jsp to point to your preferred email address.
(8) Note: if you are using Tomcat for authenticating users, you will need to add them to your conf/tomcat-users.xml file.  These users will need to be the same as the subject IDs of users identified as Subjects within Signet.

To populate the Signet demo application with sample data:
(1) Update the sample shell script util/subsystemloader/run.sh to point JAVA_HOME to the location of your JDK.
(2) Use the SubsystemXmlLoader to create the demo sample Subsystem by executing the util/subsystemloader/run.sh script with the sample demo/Subsystem.xml file, e.g., > run.sh ../../demo/data/Subsystem.xml
(3) Modify the sql/subject.sql file with any additional local Subject identities for your site, then use that file to load the sample person data.  
(4) Execute the sql/tree.sql script to load the sample organization tree data.
(5) Add login-names to your web server's authentication mechanism, with any passwords you like. Login names must correspond to the principal identifier (e.g., "jpoole" in the sample data) of one or more Subjects loaded above.
(6) A special Subject, "SignetSuperSubject", will be created by the Signet UI when it is first executed.  This is a special user that has granting privileges for all functions in all subsystems.  It can be used to bootstrap initial granting privileges for the other users.
