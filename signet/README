Signet version 0.3 - April, 2005

What's New
----------

SubjectFileLoader utility to input a set of Subject definitions via a text file.
  See demo/data/subject.txt for a sample input file with comments.
Page-headers and page-footers in the Signet GUI are now defined as Tiles, for easier site-specific customization.
Limit-values are now taken into account when creating and revoking assignments:
  Limit-values that are not assignable in a given context are now dimmed in the GUI.
  Assignments that are not revocable in a given context now have their "revoke"
  checkboxes dimmed.
Person-search in the GUI now returns only those names which match the search-string.
  This functionality is compatible with Windows IE, Windows Firefox, Mac Safari,
  and Mac Firefox.
  


Quick Start
------------------------

(1) Execute the DDL (sql/hsql.sql or sql/sybase.sql) on your database server to create the Signet database.
(2) Create a "signet" web application context in your servlet container.
(3) Point the web application context to the webapp/signet directory in this distribution.
(4) Copy your JDBC driver to two directories: webapp/signet/WEB-INF/lib and util/lib.
(5) Configure your database connection in two places: webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/hibernate.cfg.xml and util/classes/hibernate.cfg.xml. Uncomment or add a database section and set the connection parameters (@DB_URL@, @DB_USERNAME@, @DB_PASSWORD@).
(6) Set your preferred hibernate logging level in two places: webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties and util/classes/log4j.properties.
(7) Change the feedback href (@FEEDBACK_URL@) in webapp/signet/tiles/footer.jsp to point to your preferred email address.
(8) Configure your subject sources: webapp/signet/WEB-INF/classes/sources.xml. If you are using the local subject adapter, set the database connection parameters (@DB_URL@, @DB_USERNAME@, @DB_PASSWORD@).
(9) Note: if you are using Tomcat for authenticating users, you will need to add them to your conf/tomcat-users.xml file.  These users will need to be the same as the subject IDs of users identified as Subjects within Signet.

To populate the Signet demo application with sample data:
        
  (1) Load the sample organization-tree data:
    (a) Update the sample shell script util/treeloader/run.sh to point
        JAVA_HOME to the location of your JDK.
    (b) Use the TreeXMLLoader to create the demo sample organization-tree
        by executing the util/treeloader/run.sh script with the sample
        demo/Tree.xml file, e.g., > run.sh ../../demo/data/Tree.xml

  (2) Load the sample Subsystem data:
    (a) Update the sample shell script util/subsystemloader/run.sh to point
        JAVA_HOME to the location of your JDK.
    (b) Use the SubsystemXmlLoader to create the demo sample Subsystem by
        executing the util/subsystemloader/run.sh script with the sample
        demo/data/Subsystem.xml file, e.g.,
        > run.sh ../../demo/data/Subsystem.xml

  (3) Load the sample Subject data:
    (a) Update the sample shell script util/subjectloader/run.sh to point
        JAVA_HOME to the location of your JDK.
    (b) Modify the demo/data/Subject.txt file with any additional local Subject
        identities for your site.
    (c) Use the SubjectFileLoader to to load that sample person data by executing
        the util/personloader/run.sh script with the sample demo/Subject.txt
        file, e.g., > run.sh ../../demo/data/subject.txt

    Note that a special Subject, "SignetSuperSubject", is included in
    subject.txt, and so will be created by this invocation of the
    SubjectFileLoader.  This is a special user that has granting
    privileges for all functions in all subsystems.  It can be used to
    bootstrap initial granting privileges for the other users.   

  (4) Add login-names to your web server's authentication mechanism, with any
      passwords you like. Login names must correspond to the principal
      identifier (e.g., "jpoole" in the sample data) of one or more Subjects
      loaded above.
