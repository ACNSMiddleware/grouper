* code: add intersection composite member (async)
* code: delete intersection composite member (async)
* test: concurrency, deletion and async mods
* test: concurrency testing (i expect to find many bugs)
* code: class to verify that setup is functional
** find the root stem, exercise subject api, hibernate dialect + driver class, etc
* code: add `Group.canReadField(f)`
* code: add `Group.canReadField(f, subj)`
* code: add `Group.canWriteField(f)`
* code: add `Group.canWriteField(f, subj)`
* code: add `Group.getTypes()` that will return all types that the
  group has, including base but excluding internal types
* code: add `Group.getRemovableTypes()` that will return all types
  that can be removed from the group
* code: make thread sleep times (invisibly?) configurable
* code: delete custom group types
* code: internalize cache management code?
* code: update to latest subject api
