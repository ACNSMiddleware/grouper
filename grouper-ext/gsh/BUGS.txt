* 20060710  `x = last()` does not work. 
* 20060707  When using an embedded HSQLDB database for the Groups Registry on
	          Windows, the database will not always shutdown properly
	          and will require manual intervention.
* 20060623  The handling of gsh errors remains muddled, especially in regard 
            to throwing proper failure-indicating return values.
* 20060623  Multiline commands are **not** handled properly.  Long lines are
            your friend at the moment.
