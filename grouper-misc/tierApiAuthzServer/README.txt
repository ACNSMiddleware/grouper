The tier-api-server is an implementation of the TIER AuthZ Standard API, 
and is pluggable for easy Java implementation for your Groups/Permissions service.
It can either be run as a stand-alone web application, or can be easily embedded
in another Authz WS service (e.g. GrouperWS).

There are no runtime dependencies on the TIER Authz Standard API Server (except for the
J2EE Servlet Container)
