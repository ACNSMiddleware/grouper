homepage.intro.title=Grouper - getting started
homepage.intro.text=Grouper is a system for creating and maintaining institutional groups in a central repository. Groups might be used for many different reasons, such as maintaining mailing lists, determining which set of people are permitted to access specific web applications, or for sharing resources. The goal is to create a group once, but to use it as often as necessary in as wide a range of systems as possible.

#####################################################
## Define tooltips and terms here:
## tooltips must start with "tooltip."   Terms start with "term."
## there should be one and only one tooltip for a term.
## tooltips and terms are linked by the common name, 
## which is the suffix of the nav.properties key.  e.g. 
## tooltip.group=A group is a collection
## term.group=Group
## term.group=group
## 
## term.groups.3=gro
## term.groups=groups
## term.groups.1=Groups
## term.groups.2=GROUPS
## tooltip.groups=Groups are many people or groups
## 
## these are linked because they all end in "group"
##
## if you only want a tooltip on a certain message (not wherever it appears in text), 
## that is a targetted tooltip
## 
## priv.ADMIN=admin
## tooltipTargetted.priv.ADMIN=Entity may modify group attributes, delete this group or assign any privilege to any entity
##
## So wherever the message priv.ADMIN shows up, it will have a tooltip of "Entity may..."
## 
## There is another variation on this where the value of the targetted tooltip can be a reference to another tooltip
## 
## tooltipTargettedRef.priv.admin=tooltip.targetted.priv.ADMIN
