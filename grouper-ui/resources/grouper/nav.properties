homepage.intro.text=Grouper is a system for creating and maintaining institutional groups in a central repository. Such groups may be used for \
 many different reasons e.g. for mailing lists, or for determining whch set of people are allowed to access specific web applications, \
 or for sharing resources. The goal is to create a group once, but use it as often as necessary in as wide a range of systems as possible.
