<h2>Grouper - intro</h2>
<p>Grouper is a system for creating and maintaining institutional groups in a
  central repository. Such groups may be used for many different purposes
  e.g. for mailing lists, or for determining which set of people are allowed to
  access specific web applications, or for sharing resources. The goal is to create
  a group once, but use it as often as necessary in as wide a range of systems
  as possible. </p>
<p> In order to use Grouper effectively you must first understand some key concepts:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Group</dt>
  <dd>A group represents a collection of 'items' or entities which are themselves considered
    to be members of the group. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>Entity</dt>
  <dd>An entity is an abstraction for any 'item' which may be a member of a group.
    An entity has a 'type' e.g. person or group. To specify that group B is a
    member of group A is to specify that all members of group B are also members
    of group A. In the future, other entity types may be available to define
    computers or applications.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>Membership</dt>
  <dd>A specific relationship between an entity and a group.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>Folder</dt>
  <dd>A folder is a name space or container in which groups exist. Folders are hierarchical
    and may contain subfolders or groups. Folders can be used to
    collect together related groups and provide a means of controlling access
    to groups. Some examples of folders are:
    <ul>
      <li>uob>faculties>artf:fren = University of Bristol> Faculties> Arts Faculty>
        Department of French</li>
      <li>uob>personal>[username] = University of Bristol> Personal groups> [name]</li>
    </ul>
    In this web application, groups and folders are distinguished by the addition
    of square brackets [] around group names.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>Privileges</dt>
  <dd>Grouper provides fine control over who can create folders and groups, who
    can change the membership of a group, and who can grant privileges for specific
    folders or groups to others. In fact, privileges are granted to entities. By
    granting a privilege to an entity which is a group, all members of that group
    are granted the privilege (for as long as they are a member of the group).<br>
    <br>
    EveryEntity is a <em>special internal entity</em>. Any privilege granted to
    EveryEntity is, in effect, granted to all entities.<br>
    <br>
    GrouperSysAdmin is also a special internal entity which has implicit admin
    privileges for folders and groups.<br>
    <br>
    A <em>SysAdmin</em> group, if defined, conveys implicit GrouperSysAdmin privileges
    to its members. Members of this group, by default, act as themselves with
    privileges limited to those assigned to them. This UI allows SysAdmin group members
    to opt to <em>Act as admin</em>.<br/>
    <br/>
    <strong>Folder privileges</strong> </dd>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt>Create</dt>
      <dd>Entity may create groups, attributes, and subfolders in this folder</dd>
      <dt>Admin</dt>
      <dd>Entity may create groups, attributes, and subfolders in this folder, delete this folder, or assign any privilege to any entity</dd>

  <dt>Group workspace</dt>
  <dd>As described below, Grouper provides several ways of finding groups. It
    is possible, from the <em>Group Summary</em> page, to save, for the duration
    of your session, a group in a list. This menu item provides quick access to
    the groups throughout the session and provides a way of removing groups. The
    list provides the means for selecting groups for <em>Group Math</em>, described
    below. Saved groups are stored in the same list as saved entities (see belolw),
    however, this menu item filters the list to return only groups.</dd>
  <dt>Entity workspace</dt>
  <dd>Grouper provides a <em>Entity summary</em> page which can be accessed from
    many points in the UI. It is possible, from this page, to save, for the duration
    of your session, an entity in a list. This menu item provides quick access
    to the entities throughout the session and also provides a means to remove them.</dd>
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>These menu items filter the group hierarchy so that you see groups and folders
    relevant to the task you want to perform. GrouperSystemAdmin can manage all groups
    and folders and is not intended to be a group member, therefore, GrouperSystemAdmin
    does not have access to these menu items. This is also true of SystemAdminGroup
    members who have opted to <em>Act as admin</em>.</dd>

<h2>Finding groups</h2>
Grouper provides several ways of finding groups<br/>
<br/>
<dl>
  <dt>Browsing</dt>
  <dd>click on folders to find subfolders and groups:</dd>
  <dt>Listing</dt>
  <dd>with the exception of <em>All Groups</em> it is possible to hide folders and
    simply show the list of groups for a particular section. This may work well
    when there are relatively few groups</dd>
  <dt>Searching</dt>
  <dd>case-insensitive substring searching of group names below a selected folder
    is provided. There is an advanced search screen which gives the user more
    control over which attributes are searched.</dd>

  <dt>Saved groups</dt>
  <dd>as described above, groups can be saved in a list in the session for quick
    access by clicking on the appropriate menu item. </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Finding entities</h2>
Entities can be found by:<br/>
<dl>
  <dt>Browsing</dt>
  <dd>click on folders to find child groups. You can also click on a group to expand
    its membership list and select entities from that list</dd>
  <dt>Searching</dt>
  <dd>the user interface allows the user to enter a query string which is used
    to match entities. How the query string is interpreted depends on the specific
    implementation(s) of the Entity API present in the Grouper installation.
    The reference Grouper installation will return entities where:

  <ol>
    <li>any
      of the entity attributes are an exact* match for the query string</li>
    <li>the
      entity is not a person and the the query string is a substring of a entity
      attribute.</li>
    <li>the
      entity is a person and:
      <ol>
        <li>the
          query string is an exact match for a fisrt name</li>
        <li> the query string is two terms e.g. ben fiona, and the second term
          is an exact first name match, and the first term matches the start of
          the entity's surname. </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

*searches are case-insensitive</dd>
  <dt>Saved entities</dt>
  <dd>as described above, entities can be saved in a list in the session for quick
    access by clicking on the appropriate menu item. When looking for entities
    to assign membership or privileges to, the list of saved entities can be displayed
    for quick assignment to any entity in the list.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Direct vs indirect</h2>
<p>Privileges and membership of a entity for a group (Group A) may be granted
  <em>directly</em> to the entity, or may be <em>indirectly</em> derived because
  the entity is a member of a group which has been granted a privilege for Group
  A, or is, itself, a member of Group A. </p>
<p>The Grouper UI indicates whether a membership is direct, indirect or may, in
  fact, have more than one source e.g. if entity A is a member of Group A and
  Group B and both Group A and Group B are members of Group C, then entity A
  has two memberships for Group C.</p>
