<h1>Grouper UI Components</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><img src="build.png" width="573" height="447" /> </p>
<h3>Custom components</h3>
<p><strong>grouper</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Grouper API distribution includes the binary files for the Subject API 
    implementation which includes a JDBC provider and an LDAP provider.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>grouper-ui</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Source code for the Grouper UI is maintained as a separate module in the 
    Internet2 Middleware CVS repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>custom-grouper-ui</strong><em> (optional)</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sites implementing Grouper will generally want to re-brand (and perhaps heavily 
    customise) the native Grouper UI (see <a href="customising-grouper-ui.html">Customising 
    the Grouper UI</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <strong>custom subject provider</strong> <em>(optional)</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Depending on the identity management / person repository(s) in use, a site 
    may also need to implement a custom <a href="api/edu/internet2/middleware/subject/Source.html">Subject 
    provider</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Build product</h3>
<p>The Grouper UI build script compiles and combines the custom components in 
  order to create a single web application build product. This step is responsible 
  for ensuring that all required libraries (JAR files) and configuration files 
  are available on the web application class path i.e. in the <em>lib</em> or 
  <em>classes</em> directories. </p>
<h3>Application sever</h3>
<p>Once built, the web application is then deployed to an application server. 
  Currently, only Tomcat has been tested.</p>
<p>The Grouper UI does not require any container specific configuration to work.</p>
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>Grouper requires a relational database. The default is HSQLDB, however, in 
  principle, any database for which there is a JDBC driver and which is supported 
  by <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a> can be used. </p>
<p>The Subject API can be configured to work with multiple sources. JDBC and LDAP 
  providers are provided with the Subject API distribution, however, sites can 
  implement their own providers.</p>
<p>Each time the Grouper UI is built, the sources.xml and hibernate.properties 
  file are copied from grouper/conf to the web application classes directory. 
  Database components can, through these files, be configured to be on the same 
  machine or separate machines.</p>
<h2>The QuickStart distribution</h2>
<p>The default QuickStart configuration uses the same HSQLDB database as a Grouper 
  repository and as a source for the JDBC provider - the only source configured. 
  In addition, Tomcat and the HSQLDB database run on the same machine.</p>
