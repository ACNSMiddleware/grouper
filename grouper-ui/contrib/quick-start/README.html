  <tr> 
    <td>Purpose</td>
    <td>Provides a means of loading data into the Grouper repository. It was developed 
      to enable the reproducible production of a known repository for use with 
      the Grouper QuickStart distribution, but may have a more general use for 
      sites wishing to load data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>How it works</td>
    <td>Parses an XML document and exercises the Grouper API based on the XML 
      elements found</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Instructions</td>
    <td>Running ant gives further instructions, Run 'ant html' to generate Javadoc 
      (in the <a href="doc/index.html">doc</a> directory), which describes the XML format used by the loader.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Test file</td>
    <td>test.xml is an empty repository, howver, loading it without errors proves 
      that the Java source code compiled, that required JAR files are in the correct 
      location, and that the Grouper API could be initialised.</td>
