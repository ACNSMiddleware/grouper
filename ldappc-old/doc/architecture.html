<h1>Ldappc Architecture</h1>
<hr/>

<p>
This document describes the architecture of the Ldappc program.  The RFQ
document <a href=javadocSupplement/ldapConnectorRfq_8-15-06.html>
Request for Quote - LDAP Connector for Grouper & Signet</a>
should be read before reading this document.  After reading this document, 
if you desire more detailed design information, go to 
{@link edu.internet2.middleware.ldappc.documentation.Design}. 
Depending on your interest, you may also wish to go to 
{@link edu.internet2.middleware.ldappc.documentation.DeploymentGuide} 
or 
{@link edu.internet2.middleware.ldappc.documentation.UserManual}. 
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The purpose of the Ldappc program is to provide a tool and an API 
(Application Programming Interface) for provisioning group, membership and privilege 
information to an LDAP server.  The data to be provisioned is dependent on the 
Grouper and/or Signet databases and their APIs that allow access to the data.

The Ldappc program provides a command line interface for running the program
as described later.  It is also designed so that some of its capabilities constitute
an API that can be used by other programs.
</p>

<h2>Program Environment</h2>

<p> 
The Ldappc program depends the use of an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
server.  The server used for development was the OpenLDAP server.  
See <a href=http://www.openldap.org/>http://www.openldap.org</a> for additional
information about this server.  Many alternative servers exist and should work
equally well, although the Ldappc documentation will limit its discussion of
setting up the program for the OpenLDAP server.
</p>
<p> 
Depending on institutional needs, one or both of the following databases and associated
software is needed to provide the data to be provisioned: Grouper and/or Signet.
These are documented at <a href=http://grouper.internet2.edu/>http://grouper.internet2.edu</a>
and <a href=http://signet.internet2.edu/>http://signet.internet2.edu</a> respectively.
</p>

<h2>Top Level Architecture</h2>

<p> 
The relationship among the various components that Ldappc interacts with and
the code itself is well described in the diagram in the RFQ (Request for Quote) document 
referred to above.  The following provides some additional details about the provisioning 
process. 
</p>

<h3> Provisioning Control</h3>

<p> 
The provisioning of the LDAP directory is controlled using two mechanisms:
a program control interface and a program configuration interface.
</p>
<p> 
The program control interface provides simple instructions that determine 
the major types of data to be provisioned, instructions concerning the 
timestamp of the data to be selected, and the frequency of performing
the provisioning.  This interface is implemented in the program as
a processor of the command line input arguments.  However, the interface
can be used with other implementations by other programs that make use 
of the Ldappc API.
</p>
<p> 
Regardless of what is being provisioned, the program control interface
requires that a subject be identified, and all provisioning is relative 
to the privileges of the subject. 
</p>
<p> 
The program configuration interface provides simple instructions that determine 
how the major types of data are selected to be provisioned and where this 
provisioned data is to be stored in the directory.  This interface is implemented 
in the program as a processor of a configuration file.  However, the interface
can be used with other implementations by other programs that make 
use of the Ldappc API.
</p>

<h3> Provisioning in General</h3>

<p> 
Some sites will only use Signet and not use Grouper and thus will only provision 
permissions.  Others will only use Grouper and not Signet.  These may provision 
group and membership information or only groups or only memberships.  Users of the
tool will only have to provide information to the program configuration relevant
to their particular needs.
</p>

The command line parameters are meant to enable a site to decide to provision 
these three types of information independently, if they wish. Their purpose is not 
related to the criteria for selecting which sets of groups or permissions are 
subject to provisioning.

<h3> Provisioning Groups</h3>

<p> 
The process for provisioning groups begins with selecting the groups to provision.  
This is accomplished using the selection criteria provided in the configuration file.
For each selected group, using the group's DN (distinguished name), created as defined in the configuration 
file, the application determines if an entry already exists for the group in the directory, or 
a new entry must be created.  If the entry exists, it is updated with current membership data.
If the entry does not exist, the application creates a new entry for the group and stores its
membership data. 
</p>
<p>
There are two methods of storing membership data in the group entry. Either one or
both maybe used.  The first method stores the list of members in an attribute of the 
group entry (e.g., hasMember attribute).  Each member is identified by an attribute 
value of the associated Subject.  The Subject's identifying attribute
is defined in the configuration file.  
</p>
<p>
The second method stores the DN of the member's LDAP entry in an attribute of the group 
entry.  A LDAP query filter allowing the application to lookup each member's associated 
LDAP entry is provided in the configuration file.  The DN of this entry is stored in an
attribute of the Group entry. 
</p>

<h3>Provisioning Memberships</h3>  

<p> 
The process for provisioning memberships is group centric. It begins with selecting a set of
groups.  It is the memberships of those groups which are to be to provisioned.  Selecting the 
groups is accomplished using the selection criteria provided in the configuration file.  For 
each member (i.e., subject) of the selected groups, the application, using an LDAP search filter 
defined in the configuration file, attempts to locate the LDAP entry for the member.  If an 
entry is not found for the member (i.e., subject), no action is taken.  If an entry is found,
then the application lists the groups to which the member belongs in an attribute of the 
member's LDAP entry (e.g., isMemberOf).  The attribute used is defined in the configuration 
file. The list of groups is a subset of the groups selected, and each is identified by
the value of an attribute (e.g., name) defined in the configuration.
</p>

<h3>Provisioning Permissions</h3>  

<p>
The process for provisioning permissions begins with selecting all of the Subjects which
have been assigned privileges.  For each subject, the permissions to be provision are
selected.  Selecting permissions occurs in two ways as defined in the application
configuration.  Either all active permissions are selected, or permissions are selected
based on permission characteristics defined in the configuration.  After identifying a Subject
and its permissions to be provisioned, the application uses an LDAP query filter defined in 
the configuration to lookup the Subject's LDAP entry.  If no entry is found, no action takes 
place.  If the entry is found, the Subject's current permissions replace any existing 
permissions already stored in the entry.  
</p>
<p>
Permissions are stored in one of two ways.  In the first, an <i>eduPermission</i> entry is
created for each permission as a child of the Subject's entry.  In the second, each 
permission is stored in an attribute of the Subject's entry as a string.  The format of the permission
string and the attribute where the permissions are stored are defined in the configuration 
file.
</p>

<h3>Provisioning Schema</h3>  

<p> 
To accomplish the above provisioning, additional schema are needed beyond
those that are standard LDAP schema.  These are included in a file,
ldappc.schema and include objectclass definitions for <i>eduPermissions</i>
and <i>eduMember</i>. The eduPermissions objectclass is required if the application
is to store provisioned permissions as eduPermission entries.  The eduMember objectclass
is provided as convience as it includes "hasMember" and "isMemberOf" attributes used to
describe membership relationships.  The eduMember objectclass is used for the default 
configuration of the application.  This schema file needs to be made available to the 
LDAP server being used.  
</p>
