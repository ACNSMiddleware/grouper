<h1>Ldappc Users Manual</h1>
<hr/>

<p>
This document describes how to use the Ldappc program. This document is not
yet complete. The discussion that is provided is limited to some of the
program documentation and does not currently include discussion of the API.
</p>

<p>
The user instructs the program on what actions to take using two separate
mechanisms, command line input and a configuration file. The command line
input determines the categories of data to be provisioned to the LDAP
database. The configuration file determines the details of how the data is to
be provisioned. The sections below describe these two mechanisms.
</p>

<h2>Command Line Input</h2>

<p>
The command line parameters are meant to enable a site to decide to provision
groups, memberships, or permissions independently. The command line is not
used as a criteria for selecting which sets of groups, memberships, or
permissions are subject to provisioning. The later is the role of the
configuration file and its processor.
</p>

<p>
The Program can be started from the command line with the following
parameters. Replace the names listed under the Value column with actual
values. Enter the keys exactly as shown.
</p>

</table>

<p>
When the <code>-groups</code> argument is present, Grouper group information will be
provisioned into LDAP group entries per declarations in the configuration
file.
</p>

<p>
When the <code>-memberships</code> argument is present, Grouper group membership
information will be provisioned into LDAP entries corresponding to members
per declarations in the configuration file.
</p>

<p>
When the <code>-permissions</code> argument is present, Signet permission information
will be provisioned into LDAP entries corresponding to privilegees per
declarations in the configuration file.
</p>

<p>
If the <code>-interval</code> parameter is present, the Program will continue to operate
until killed; otherwise, it performs one provisioning cycle and terminates.
</p>

<h2>The Configuration File</h2>

<p>
Most of the details concerning the configuration file are contained in a
configuration file template discussed below. This section describes some
important concepts in how the configuration file gets used and describes some
details not discussed in the template.
</p>

<h3>Configuration Overview</h3>

<p>
The configuration file is an XML document organized by configuration elements
necessary for provisioning Grouper data, elements necessary for provisioning
Signet data, and elements common to both. An overview of the configuration
file is provided below. The reader should view the configuration file
template for specific details. The configuration file is designed such that
users only need to defined those elements specific to their situation. For
example, in a environment which utilizes only Grouper and not Signet, the
Signet configuration elements can be removed (or commented out) from the
configuration file.
</p>

<h3>Common Configuration Elements</h3>

<p>
There are two configuration elements common to both Signet and Grouper. They
are the <code>ldap</code> and <code>source-subject-identifiers</code>
elements. The <code>ldap</code> element defines the values necessary to
interact with the LDAP directory where provisioned data will reside.
Currently this is limited to the parameters necessary to connect with the
directory. The parameters are based on JNDI, and their values may vary
according to the directory server being used.
</p>

<p>
The <code>source-subject-identifiers</code> element identifies for each
Subject source how the provisioner locates the directory entry for a given
Subject. Within both Grouper and Signet, Subjects can originate from multiple
sources. When provisioning data for a Subject (either memberships or
permissions) it is necessary to locate the Subject's directory entry in order
to either store data (e.g., when provisioning permissions) or obtain the
Subject's DN (e.g., when tracking memberships by DN during group
provisioning). This is accomplished by defining for each source the Subject
attribute whose value uniquely identifies the Subject within the directory,
and an LDAP query filter that when combined with the attribute value locates
the Subject's directory entry.
</p>

<h3>Signet Configuration Elements</h3>

<p>
The <code>signet</code> element contains the configuration elements needed
for provisioning Signet permissions. There is one required element,
<code>permissions-listing</code>. This element defines how provisioned
permissions are stored within the directory. There are two supported storage
methods. One method stores each of the Subject's permissions as a child
<em>eduPermission</em> entry of the Subject's directory entry. This method
requires the <em>eduPermission</em> schema to be available to the directory
server. The other method stores the permissions in a string format within an
attribute of the Subject's directory entry. The attribute to be used on the
Subject's directory entry and part of the string format are defined here.
</p>

<p>
There are two methods for identifying the permissions to be provisioned.
Either all active permissions can be provisioned, or permissions can be
further limited by permission characteristics. The optional
<code>permissions-queries</code> element defines the characteristics to use
for selecting permissions to be provisioned. Two characteristics, functions
and subsystems, are supported. The <code>subsystem-queries</code> element
defines the subsystems to limit permissions. A permission must be associated
with at least one of the subsystems for it to be selected for provisioning.
The <code>function-queries</code> element identifies the functions to limit
permissions. A permission must be associated with at least one of the
functions for it to be selected for provisioning. If both the
<code>subsystem-queries</code> and <code>function-queries</code> elements
are defined, a permission only needs to satisfy one of those to be selected
for provisioning.
</p>

<h3>Grouper Configuration Elements</h3>

<p>
The <code>grouper</code> element contains the configuration elements for
Grouper. Whether provisioning memberships or groups, the provisioner takes a
group centric approach for selecting the provisioned data. In particular, the
provisioner selects a set of groups. This set of groups either is the
collection of groups to provision, or the membership of these selected groups
defines the memberships to be provisioned. The provisioner selects groups
based on subordinate stem or attribute value matching queries. The
<code>group-queries</code> element contains the definitions of the queries
to use when selecting the groups that define the provisioning data.
</p>

<p>
Either groups, memberships or both may be provisioned when provisioning
Grouper data. The <code>grouper</code> element splits the configuration
items for groups and memberships into the elements <code>groups</code> and
<code>memberships</code> respectively. The user need only define the
element or elements necessary for the data being provisioned. Each is
described further below.
</p>

<p>
Provisioning groups requires the provisioner to create new or maintain
existing Group directory entries. The <code>groups</code> element defines
the needed information for this. This element identifies the root entry in
the directory under which all group entries are maintained. It must be noted
that the provisioner owns all entries under this root element. In particular,
it can add, modify and delete any entries under the root element. The
provisioner creates new entries based on the objectclass defined here. The
Group entries can be create either in a "flat" or a "bushy" structure. If the
structure is flat, then all Group entries are children of the root entry and
the RDN of the Group entry is the value of either the "id" or "name"
attribute of the Group. If the structure is bushy, then a heirarchy of
organizationalUnit entries is created under the root entry for each element
of the Group's stem, the Group entry is created under the parent stem's OU
entry, and the RDN is set to the Group's extension. It should be noted that
the attribute name of the RDN of the Group may not be <em>ou</em>. This
prevents naming collisions between stem entries and the group entry when the
"bushy" structure is used.
</p>

<p>
The <code>groups</code> element defines two methods of storing membership
information in a Group's directory entry. They can be used simultaneously.
The first is to maintain an attribute with the list of members identified by
an attribute value from the associated Subject found via the Grouper API. The
<code>group-members-name-list</code> element defines the Group entry
attribute where this list is maintained. It has a child element,
<code>source-subject-name-mapping</code>, that defines, by Subject source,
the Subject attribute whose value is the indentifier stored in the list
(e.g., loginId attribute). If the <code>group-members-name-list</code>
element is not defined, then this membership list is not maintained.
</p>

<p>
The second storage method is to store the DN of the associated directory
entry for each member. The directory entry for each member is identified
using the information from the <code>source-subject-identifiers</code>
element (see above). The existence of the <code>group-members-dn-list</code>
element identifies that the DN list is to be maintained and defines the
attribute to hold the DN list. If an entry cannot be found for a member, no
DN is included in the membership list for that member.
</p>

<p>
The <code>groups</code> element also provides a means of provisioning
attribute values of the Group to the Group's directory entry. This is
accomplished using the optional <code>group-attribute-mapping</code>
element. This element maps a selected set of Group attributes to the
corresponding directory entry attributes. The value from the Group attribute
is provisioned to the directory entry attribute.
</p>

<p>
The <code>memberships</code> element contains the configuration items
related to provisioning memberships. It currently has only one child element,
<code>member-groups-list</code>. The <code>member-groups-list</code>
element defines how the list of Groups to which a member belongs is
maintained. This list is maintained on the member's associated directory
entry. The <code>member-groups-list</code> element defines the attribute on
the entry where the list is stored. It also defines the Group attribute whose
value is used to identify the Group within the list.
</p>

<h3>Attributes</h3>

<p>
The provisioning process expects the attribute name used to
query for the attribute values is the name returned by the Ldap server.
Depending on the attribute name defined in the configuration file this may not be the case.  
For example, there are many Ldap servers (e.g., OpenLDAP) that support synonyms for
attribute names. If a synonym is used, the server may return the canonical name 
rather than the synonym. Unexpected errors may occur in
the provisioning process in this situation. This same issue arises if the
Ldap server being used supports <em>attribute subclassing</em> or <em>attribute
language preferences</em>. Deployers will need to select attribute names 
appropriately for their environment.
</p>

<p>
The provisioning process assumes that attribute values returned from the Ldap server
via Java JNDI are strings.  It is possible that some attribute values are not returned as strings.
This is dependent on the directory server and the JNDI service provider. For example,
Sun's LDAP provider uses byte arrays to represent attribute values with nonstring 
attribute syntaxes, and strings are used to represent values of all other syntaxes. In the
case of Sun's LDAP provider the number of attribute values represented as byte arrays is 
minimal and shouldn't present a problem to the deployer (see the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/ldap/misc/attrs.html">Java JNDI Tutorial</a>
for more details).  Deployers will need to select attributes appropriate for their environment.
</p>

<h3>Configuration Side Effects</h3>

<p>
It is important to understand the possible side effects of modifying the
configuration file after the initial provisioning. When provisioning groups
or memberships, the selection of groups completely determines the data being
provisioned. Modifying the selection parameters (e.g., modifying the
<code>group-queries</code> element) can result in a group or membership no
longer being included in the directory even though the group or membership
still exists within Grouper. The same issue exists when provisioning
permissions. Modifying the <code>permissions-queries</code> element can
significantly alter the permissions to be provisioned.
</p>

<p>
Many of the configuration elements allow a directory entry attribute to be
defined where a list is to be maintained. When an attribute where a list is
being maintained is altered, the provisioner no longer has any reference to
the original attribute. It will be the responsibility of the user to maintain
the original attribute.
</p>

<p>
The provisioning process assumes ownership of all attributes and entries that
are defined in the configuration file. It adds and deletes values from these
attributes and entries based completely on the data selected from within
Grouper or Signet. For example, any existing data in an attribute prior to
the provisioning process is disregarded by the provisioning process. There is
one exception to this. When provisioning permissions as strings, the
provisioning process only assumes ownership of the attribute values that
start with the prefix defined in the <code>permissions-listing</code>
element in the configuration file
</p>

<p>
The membership and permissions provisioning processes remove any previously
provisioned memberships or permissions stored on directory entries that are
no longer valid. This can occur for example if a Group is deleted from
Grouper, a privileged subject no longer exists in Signet, or the
<code>group-queries</code> or <code>permissions-queries</code> elements
are altered. This process considers any entry found using the filters defined
in the <code>source-subject-identifiers</code> element with the <em>{0}</em>
parameter replaced by <em>*</em> and having the appropriate attribute
populated as an entry that previously had data provisioned. These entries are
updated be consistent with the provisioned memberships or permissions.
</p>

<h3>The Configuration File Template</h3>

<p>
A template for creating the configuration file that controls how the data
categories selected on the command line us provided in the conf directory as
"ldappcTemplate.xml". The user should first copy this file into the config
directory and name it ldappc.xml. Then modify it according to the
instructions therein.
</p>

<h2>Ldappc Processing</h2>

<h3>Value Comparisons</h3>

<p>
The provisioning process needs to compare attribute values in order to determine
the data to be stored in an attribute, and to determine how to updated an attribute
efficiently.  The provisioning process uses a case insensitive string comparison of
values to determine equality. This can possibly effect the performance of the
provisioning process or the accuracy of the data stored in the directory.  Each
situation is described below. 
</p>

<p>
The provisioning process attempts to minimize the number of updates made
to the directory.  To do this requires comparing the current set of data stored
in an attribute with the set of data being provisioned to that attribute.
The number and type of modifications identified for the attribute are based on 
examining the differences in the two data sets.  The comparison of the two 
data sets is performed by the provisioning process using a case insensitive 
comparison of the value strings.  This is performed in the Java application, and
does not utilize any Ldap compare functionality provided by the directory.
As such, if the directory should modify provisioned data in any way when stored (e.g., 
store it in a standard format, remove leading or trailing spaces), the
provisioning process may perform unnecessary updates on the attribute as it 
may view equivalent values as different.  This situation can also occur if the 
directory supports a more robust comparison operation on the attribute. Although
unneeded updates are performed to the directory, the data will remain accurate.
</p>

<p>
The case insensitive string value comparison used by the provisioning process
may cause provisioned data to be inaccurate in the following situations.  If 
the data being provisioned is case sensitive, values that should be included in
the provisioned data set may not be.  If equality of the data being provisioned 
cannot be determined via string comparison, the data stored in the directory may 
not be accurate. For example, if a date value is being stored in a Group attribute
within Grouper, the two values "12 May 1990" and "May 12 1990" will not be considered 
equal by the provisioning process.  Both values will be included in the provisioned data
set.
</p>

<p>
There is one exception to this discussion.  When the group members DN list is being 
maintained on the provisioned Group entries, these values are always compared as
parsed DN strings.  This ensures that DNs will always compare correctly.  For example,
the two DNs <em>first=fred+last=flintstone,ou=bedrock</em> and <em>last=flintstone+first=fred,ou=bedrock</em>
will compare equal.
</p>
