<h1>Ldappc Release Notes</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Changes in version 1.1</h2>
<p>
Updated grouper API from 1.0.1 to 1.3 snapshot.
Updated subject API from 0.2.1 to 1.3.1.
Made numerous performance changes to increase speed.

This involved resolving:
<table border="0" cellspacing="2em">
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
MCO-2</td><td align="left" valign="top">LDAPpc should have LDAP connection pooling on by default
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
MCO-6</td><td align="left" valign="top">LDAPpc does not accurately provision groups under heavy load
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
MCO-7</td><td align="left" valign="top">LDAPpc error logs report spurious null DTO
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
MCO-8</td><td align="left" valign="top">Update Ldappc to use better child group query filter
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
MCO-11</td><td align="left" valign="top">LDAPPC fails when trying to provision very large groups
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
It is quite possible that MCO-6 and MCO-11 have not been completely fixed.
