*** REAME.txt File for the Ldappc Installation ***

For those who have the distribution tar file, installation instructions 
for the program exist in Javadoc format and can be found by expanding the
tar file and navigating to the file, doc/javadoc/index.html, under 
the installation directory and opening the file in a browser window.  
This presents you with the Javadoc for Ldappc that contains
a documentation package, edu.internet2.middleware.ldappc.documentation.  
On this page you can access any of the available documents either directly 
or by selecting the DocumentationRoadmap link.  These documents include 
architecture, design, LDAP, and deployment guides plus a user's manual.  
You can directly select the DeploymentGuide link for detailed documentation 
about the installation process.

For those who are accessing the program using CVS, run "ant docs" from the 
working directory; this will generate the javadoc in the doc directory.
then open the doc/javadoc/index.html file in a browser window.
