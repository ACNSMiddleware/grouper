*** REAME.txt File for the Ldappc Installation ***

For those who have the distribution tar file, installation instructions 
for the program exist in HTML format and can be found by expanding the
tar file and navigating to the file, doc/index.html, under the installation
directory and opening the file in a browser window.  

This presents you with the main documentation links for Ldappc, plus the
Javadoc.  On this page you can access any of the available documents.  These
documents include architecture, design, LDAP, and deployment guides plus a
user's manual.  You can directly select the "Deployment Guide" link for
detailed documentation about the installation process.

For those who are accessing the program using CVS who wish to view the
Javadoc, run "ant docs" from the working directory; this will generate the
javadoc in the doc directory.  Then open the doc/javadoc/index.html file in a
browser window.
